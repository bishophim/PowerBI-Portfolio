# Power BI Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my Power BI project portfolio.
This repository showcases a collection of dashboards and analytical projects developed throughout my journey as an analyst.
Each project is built from csv datasets containing thousands of records, involving end-to-end work such as data transformation, data modelling, DAX development, dashboard UI/UX design, and translating findings into meaningful insights.

## [Project 1: Pixar Showcase](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZmY1ZjUzYjgtMzRmNS00YzA5LWE2NDctYTIwMDgyNzIyZjA1IiwidCI6IjcxNWNlYjVmLTk4YzgtNDkxMy04YjVhLWUxMjE4NjE1YTgxYyJ9)

The purpose of this showcase is to visualise a summary of the sample data of Pixar films from 1995 to 2024. Compared to a traditional dashboard, an interactive rewind function stands its influence, which gives the audience a much more joyful experience while reading the data, can also be a chance to promote/ recall certain content. In this showcase, the rewind function is aimed at being used in conferences and other situations to promote Pixar films. Bringing films' screenshots/trailers/ characters/ history lines to the audience shall effectively increase the audience interest, which should be a potential method to target multiple audiences. Moreover, an interactive dashboard, as always, highlights the important indicators like revenue/ profit/ trend/ score etc. Users can easily find insights or trends based on what they are looking for.
